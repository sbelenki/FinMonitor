# FinMonitor

A prototype of on-line monitoring system for a list of financial instruments.

## Motivation

This is a playground for testing automated low frequency strategies based on Pandas and freely available financial data. The background reading for the project was [Mastering Pandas for Finance by Michael Heydt]( https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Pandas-Finance-Michael-Heydt/dp/1783985100) that got me thinking about how far it is possible to push the limits of automated system built on freely available APIs and financial data.
